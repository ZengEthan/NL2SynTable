# Project Overview

This project contains three Python scripts designed for generating JSON data, generating Python code using a GPT model, and creating datasets. These scripts are useful for data processing, machine learning, and automated code generation.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `generate_json.py`

**Functionality:**
This script converts data into JSON format, making it suitable for scenarios requiring structured JSON data generation.

**Usage:**
```bash
python generate_json.py [arguments]
```

### 2. `generate_python_gpt.py`

**Functionality:**
This script generates Python code by leveraging a GPT model, useful for automated script generation and code assistance.

**Usage:**
```bash
python generate_python_gpt.py [arguments]
```

### 3. `generate_dataset.py`

**Functionality:**
This script is used for generating and processing datasets, particularly for training and evaluating machine learning models.

**Usage:**
```bash
python generate_dataset.py [arguments]
```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries. It is recommended to use Python 3.8 or later.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
